  # Core Rule 4 - No sexual or shock content
  There is zero tolerance for ERP (erotic roleplay), sexual language, and sexual references.

  Players may encounter potentially shocking themes such as gore, drug abuse, and suicide. You are highly discouraged from adding more details than necessary for roleplay or in-game mechanics.
