  # Core Rule 8 - Do not use exploits or cheats
  You may report bugs and vulnerabilities through either the Wizard's Den Space Station 14 Github repo https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/issues or the ahelp (admin help) system.

  Do not exploit bugs that interrupts roundflow, modifies character properties, or causes sensory overload. Do not exploit vulnerabilities in server code.

  You may use external resources and programs if they do not perform in-game actions or provide real-time information.
