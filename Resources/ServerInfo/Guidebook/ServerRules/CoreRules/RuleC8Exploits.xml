  # Core Rule 8 - Do not abuse bugs or exploit vulnerabilities
  You may report bugs and vulnerabilities through either the Wizard's Den Space Station 14 Github repo https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/issues or the ahelp (admin help) system.

  There is zero tolerance for triggering bugs that interrupts roundflow, modifies character properties, or causes sensory overload. There is also zero tolerance for exploiting vulnerabilities in servers or clients.

  External resources and programs are allowed provided they do not perform or actively assist in-game actions.
