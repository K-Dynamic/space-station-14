  # Core Rule 9 - Do not multikey or share accounts
  Using or creating alternative accounts is referred to as "multikey" and will result in bans for all accounts.

  Players must not share accounts with other players. If purposefully shared, you are responsible for actions and consequences by others using your account.

  Creating an account while banned is considered ban evasion.

  ## Switching to a new account
  If you lose access to or abandon an account, you must notify admins of your old username at https://forum.spacestation14.com/c/general/4 before creating a new account.
