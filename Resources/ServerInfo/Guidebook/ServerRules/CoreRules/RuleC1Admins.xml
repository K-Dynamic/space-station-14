  # Core Rule 1 - Listen to admins and use ahelp
  Admin help ("ahelp") is a system for admins to communicate with players, log issues, and provide in-game interventions. All ahelps are relayed to Discord.

  Players must listen to admins without debating rules. Admins may intervene, make final interpretations, and override rules to improve overall community experience, but are held accountable when exercising this privilege. (Server rules are not perfect and may not fit every situation.)

  If you disagree with admin actions and rule interpretations, submit a staff complaint on the forums at https://forum.spacestation14.com/w/complaint-wizard

  ## What and when should I ahelp?
  Ahelp as soon as you think a player is breaking rules; it is better to misreport than to wait or not report at all. (The most common reason to not ahelp is saving admin time and workload. However, it only take a few seconds for admins to check if someone is an antagonist or a raider.)

  Ahelps must state what the issue is at minimum. Ideal ahelps include events leading up to the issue and who was involved. During ahelp, do not ignore messages or disconnect without notifying the admin. Admins may not always respond if they offline or have resolved the issue.

  Antagonists may use ahelp for requests, while non-antagonists must use In-Character ("IC") methods like prayers, faxes, and phones.
