  # Core Rule 1 - Admins have final say
  Do not debate rules with admins. If you disagree with their actions and rule interpretations, submit a staff complaint on the forums at https://forum.spacestation14.com/w/complaint-wizard

  Admins may intervene, override rules and make final interpretations to improve overall community experience. Admins are accountable for their actions when exercising this privilege. (Server rules are not written perfectly and may not fit every situation.)
