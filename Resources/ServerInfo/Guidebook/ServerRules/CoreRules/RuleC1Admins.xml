  # Core Rule 1 - Admins have final say
  Admins may intervene to improve overall server experience, even if no rules were technically broken.

  Do not debate server rules. If you disagree with admin actions and interpretations of rules, then submit a staff complaint on the official forums.

  Server rules are not written perfectly and may not fit every situation. Admins can override rules and make final interpretations in the interests of the server or community at large.

  Even if you disagree, you must follow their interpretation as they are accountable for their actions when exercising this privilege.
