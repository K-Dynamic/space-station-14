  # Core Rule 1 - Listen to admins and use ahelp
  Admin help ("ahelp") is a system for admins to communicate with players, log issues, and provide in-game interventions. All ahelps are relayed privately to admins to Discord.

  Players must listen to admins without debating rules. Admins may intervene, make final interpretations, and override rules to improve overall community experience, but are held accountable when exercising this privilege. (Server rules are not perfect and may not fit every situation.)

  If you disagree with admin actions and rule interpretations, submit a staff complaint on the forums at https://forum.spacestation14.com/w/complaint-wizard

  ## What and when should I ahelp?
  You should ahelp as soon as you think a player is breaking server rules; it is better to misreport issues than to wait it out or not report at all. (Players often avoid ahelp as they believe they are saving admin time and workload. However, it only take a few seconds for admins to determine if an issue is caused by a raider, and longer ahelp delays causes longer ahelp resolutions.)

  Ahelps must state what the issue is at minimum. Ideal ahelps include events leading up to the issue and who was involved. During ahelp, do not ignore messages or disconnect without notifying the admin. Admins may not always respond if they offline or have resolved the issue.

  Antagonists may use ahelp for requests, while non-antagonists must use In-Character ("IC") methods like prayers, faxes, and phones.
