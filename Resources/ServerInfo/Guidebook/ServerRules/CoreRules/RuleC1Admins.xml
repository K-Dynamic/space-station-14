  # Core Rule 1 - Admins have final say
  Do not debate server rules with admins. If you disagree with admin actions and interpretations of rules, submit a staff complaint on the official Space Station 14 forums at https://forum.spacestation14.com/w/complaint-wizard

  Admins may intervene to improve overall server experience, even if no rules were technically broken.

  Server rules are not written perfectly and may not fit every situation. Admins can override rules and make final interpretations in the interests of the server or community at large.

  You must follow their interpretation as they are accountable for their actions when exercising this privilege.
