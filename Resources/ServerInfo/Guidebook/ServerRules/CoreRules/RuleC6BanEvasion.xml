  # Core Rule 6 - No ban discussion or evasion
  This is a zero tolerance rule.

  You may only discuss bans at https://forum.spacestation14.com/c/ban-appeals/appeals-game/40

  Unless you are completing antagonist objectives, do not evade role bans by gaining access to, impersonating, or taking over a banned roles.
