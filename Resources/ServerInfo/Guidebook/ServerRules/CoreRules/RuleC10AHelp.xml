  # Core Rule 10 - Do not abuse or ignore admin messages
  Admin help ("ahelp") is the system used for players and admins to communicate in-game, which allows admins to log issues and intervene. All ahelps are relayed to Discord.

  If you ignore ahelp messages or disconnect without telling the admin, you may be warned or banned.

  IC methods of contacting admins (prayers, faxes, red and banana phones) must be used when requesting gimmicks, though antagonists may use ahelp.

  For various reasons, admins may not respond to an ahelp as they may be offline or have resolved the issue.

  ## Should I ahelp X?
  Ahelp as soon as possible if you believe a player is breaking a rule.

  Some ahelps may not need admin intervention. However, it is better to misreport issues than to wait until the round is over or not report at all. You will not be punished for ahelping.

  (The most common reason for not ahelping is to save admin time and workload. However, it only takes a few seconds for an admin to check if someone is an antagonist.

  If you are ahelping too frequently, an admin will let you know without warning or punishment.)

  # What should I include in an ahelp?
  At minimum, admins must know what the issue is and who is causing it to reply or intervene.

  An ideal ahelp message should also detail the timeline, events leading up to the issue, and other players that were involved.

  # Examples
  Appropriate uses of ahelp:
  - reporting players who you believe are violating rules,
  - asking questions about rules,
  - asking for a temporary exemption from a rule, and
  - request a minor gimmick as an antagonist, like a TC trade or item spawn.

  Inappropriate uses of ahelp:
  - checking if an admin is online, including sending messages without any information about the issue like "hello" or other unclear messages,
  - being hostile or aggressive,
  - requesting events, and
  - spamming messages about the same issue.
