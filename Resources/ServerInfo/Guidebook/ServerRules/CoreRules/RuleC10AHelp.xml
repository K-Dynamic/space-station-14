  # Core Rule 10 - Do not abuse or ignore admin messages
  Admin help ("ahelp") is a system for admins to communicate with players, log issues, and intervene. All ahelps are relayed to Discord.

  You may be warned or banned if you ignore ahelp messages or disconnect without informing the admin.

  Antagonists may use ahelp for requests. Players must use prayers, faxes, or phones for requests.

  Admins may not always respond to an ahelp if they offline or have resolved the issue.

  ## Should I ahelp X?
  Ahelp as soon as possible if you believe a player is breaking a rule.

  You will not be punished for ahelping; it is better to misreport issues than to wait or not report at all.

  (The most common reason for not ahelping is to save admin time and workload. However, admins only take a few seconds to check if someone is an antagonist.

  If you ahelp too frequently, an admin will inform you without consequence.)

  # What should I include in an ahelp?
  At minimum, ahelps must include what the issue is and who is causing it.

  Ideal ahelps include events leading to the issue, and the involvment of yourself and other players.

  # Examples
  Appropriate uses of ahelp:
  - Reporting players who you believe are breaking rules
  - Asking about rules or their interpretation
  - Requesting temporary exemption from a rule
  - Requesting a gimmick as an antagonist, like a TC trade or item spawn

  Prohibited uses of ahelp:
  - Checking for admins by sending unclear messages like "hello"
  - Being hostile, aggressive, or willfully ignorant
  - Requesting events
  - Spamming messages
