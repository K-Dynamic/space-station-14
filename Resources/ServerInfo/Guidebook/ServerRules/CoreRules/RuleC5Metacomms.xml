  # Core Rule 5 - No communication beyond In-Character methods
  This is a zero tolerance rule. Until the round ends (round end summary) or is in the lobby stage, do not discuss current round details beyond IC (In-Character) methods.

  You may use the LOOC (Local Out-of-Character) channel to teach gameplay mechanics and to inform of ongoing bugs.

  ## Broadcasting
  When broadcasting a round through a stream or call, you must kick and ahelp others playing in the same round, as well as hide or delete current round information shared by others. Using a stream delay to reduce current round information leaks is highly recommended.

  Do not view a stream or listen to a call while connected to the same round.
