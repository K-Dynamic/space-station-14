  # Core Rule 5 - Do not metacom
  Sharing current round information outside In-Character ("IC") channels is considered "metacom" and prohibited; you must wait for the end round screen to appear before discussing the round.

  Bypassing IC speech accents and restrictions is considered metacom and prohibited.

  Players may teach gameplay mechanics within the Local Out-of-Character ("LOOC") channel. You are highly encouraged to teach players within IC channels.

  ## Streaming
  While streaming a round, you must kick and report viewers playing in the same round, as well as hide or delete current round information shared by viewers. Using a stream delay is highly recommended.

  Viewing a stream while connected the same round ("stream sniping") is prohibited.
