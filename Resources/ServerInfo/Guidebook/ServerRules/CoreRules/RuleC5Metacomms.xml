  # Core Rule 5 - Do not share current round information beyond In-Character methods
  This is a zero tolerance rule.

  Sharing current round information beyond In-Character ("IC") methods is considered "metacom" and prohibited. You must wait for the round end summary before discussing the round beyond IC.

  Players may use the Local Out-of-Character ("LOOC") channel to teach gameplay mechanics and to inform others of ongoing bugs.

  ## Streaming
  When streaming a round, you must kick and ahelp viewers playing in the same round, as well as hide or delete current round information shared by viewers. Using a stream delay to reduce current round information leaks is highly recommended.

  Viewing a stream while connected the same round ("stream sniping") is prohibited.
