  # Core Rule 5 - No communication beyond In-Character methods
  This is a zero tolerance rule. Until the round end summary appears, do not discuss current round details beyond IC (In-Character) methods.

  You may use the LOOC (Local Out-of-Character) channel to teach gameplay mechanics and to inform of ongoing bugs.

  ## Streaming
  When streaming a round, you must kick and ahelp viewers playing in the same round, as well as hide or delete current round information shared by viewers. Using a stream delay to reduce current round information leaks is highly recommended.

  Viewing a stream while connected the same round is prohibited.
