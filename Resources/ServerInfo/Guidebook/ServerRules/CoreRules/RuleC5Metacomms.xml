  # Core Rule 5 - Do not metacom
  Sharing ongoing round information outside the game is considered external communication ("metacom") and prohibited; you must wait for the end round screen before discussing the round. This rule also applies for other non-Wizard's Den servers.

  ## Streaming
  Viewing a stream while connected the same round ("stream sniping") is prohibited.

  When streaming, you must kick and report viewers playing in the same round, and hide or delete ongoing round information shared by viewers. You are highly recommended to use a stream delay while streaming.
